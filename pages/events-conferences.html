  <h1>Events &amp; Conferences</h1>
  <p>One of the great things about the jQuery community is that everyone does their part. From creating products using jQuery to hosting local meetups, conferences and meetings. It is important when creating your own meeting, gathering, local meetup or even conference that you properly present the jQuery Brand. We’ve outlined the dos and don’ts below as well as defined the difference between a community hosted event and a jQuery Foundation hosted/approved event.</p>

	<h2>Naming your jQuery event:</h2>

	<p>If you’re familiar with the jQuery brand and the jQuery community, then you’re probably familiar with the fact that there are many different types of meetups and conferences all dedicated to jQuery.</p>

	<h3>When naming your own jQuery event:</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Feel free to utilize the name “jQuery” to promote your event.</li>
		<li>Do not use the word “Conference” in your naming formula.</li>
		<li>Do not include any sponsors' names in your naming formula.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We’ve even created a small formula for you to use to properly promote your event:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>jQuery [Event Title] [Place]</li>
		<li><strong>Good:</strong> jQuery in the Bayou, New Orleans</li>
		<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Mom &amp; Pop’s Hardware jQuery Thanksgiving Conference of Awesome</li>
	</ul>

	<p>However, please do not use any version of “jQuery Conference,” as this is reserved for use by the jQuery Foundation and people who have obtained the proper approval from the jQuery Foundation, which we will explain more about below.</p>

	<h3>Promoting your jQuery event:</h3>

	<p>The jQuery suite of logos is available to be used, unaltered, to promote your event. We’ve outlined the proper uses for each individual logo under the previous “logos” section in the brand guidelines. Below are some things we would like you to avoid:</p>

	<p>Also, we strongly suggest having an open and public Call For Speakers within your local community for your event. After all, that is what jQuery thrives on: the input of our community.</p>

</div>

<div id="event-rules" class="ten">

	<h3>Last, but not least, some rules for your event:</h3>

	<p>We highly encourage you to provide links to the presenter content and make your presentations available online. You may host your event site on your own domain (ie: jqueryasia.com) or contact and work with the jQuery Foundation to be included on our event website. However, with this content, you may not keep your video content behind a “paywall” available to in-person attendees or released later for a fee.</p>

	<h2>jQuery Developer Summit</h2>

	<p>Earlier in these brand guidelines we mentioned the use of “Conference” being strictly reserved for the jQuery Foundation, however we host another event as well: <strong>The jQuery Developer Summit</strong></p>
	
	<img class="p-small" src="/resources/jquery-dev-summit-mark.gif" alt="jQuery Developer Summit Mark">

	<p>The jQuery Developer Summit is a hands-on, contribution-fest meant to foster engagement in the development process by the community, while also pushing the different projects forward. It’s designed to help on-board people who have wanted to contribute to jQuery, but haven’t had the chance to take the first step and inculcate them into the “open source” workflow - e.g., using Git and GitHub, making pull requests, communicating with a distributed, async team, and have them also make the in-person connections that make online collaboration more fruitful. It’s a way for the different teams to make a lot of progress on specific issues, incorporating efforts from old-timers and newcomers alike, and providing organic opportunities to learn and exercise new skills while contributing existing ones.</p>

	<h3>Spacing Guidelines</h3>

	<img class="p-small" src="/resources/jquery-dev-summit-mark-spacing.gif" alt="jQuery Developer Summit Mark &ndash; Spacing">

	<p class="db">The jQuery Developer Summit brand can be used by the community to promote the event. However, there are some rules to increase the legibility and retain the strength of the brand.</p>

	<h3>Improper Usage</h3>

	<img class="p-small" src="/resources/jquery-dev-summit-mark-improper-usage.gif" alt="jQuery Developer Summit Mark &ndash; Improper Usage">

	<p>Please keep the jQuery Developer Summit brand mark always visible within your promotional material.</p>
